//PRACTICE USING CRUD QUERIES




// Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
use my_first_db

//Create students collection.
db.createCollection("students")

//Each document you insert into this collection should have the following 
//format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, 
//birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})

//Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
db.students.insert({name: "Trinity", home_state: "IL", lucky_number: 7, birthday: {month: 02, day: 07, year: 1973}})
db.students.insert({name: "Adrian", home_state: "LA", lucky_number: 2, birthday: {month: 10, day: 17, year: 1959}})
db.students.insert({name: "Trudy", home_state: "LA", lucky_number: 9, birthday: {month: 08, day: 08, year: 1962}})
db.students.insert({name: "Fred", home_state: "AL", lucky_number: 3, birthday: {month: 12, day: 02, year: 1987}})
db.students.insert({name: "Martha", home_state: "CA", lucky_number: 4, birthday: {month: 05, day: 27, year: 1994}})

//Get all students.
db.students.find({}).pretty()

//Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.find({home_state: "CA"}, {home_state:"WA"}).pretty()

//Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lt: 3}}).pretty()

//Get all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}}).pretty()

//Get all students whose lucky number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gte: 1, $lte: 9}}).pretty()

//Add a field named 'interests' to all student documents in the collection
//The field should be an array and contain the following entries: 'coding', 
// 'brunch', MongoDB'. Add this field to all documents using a single command.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {interests: ['coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB']}})

//Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
db.students.update({name: 'Trinity'}, {$push: {interests: 'True Crime'}})

//Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
db.students.update({name: 'Adrian'}, {$push: {interests: 'Taxes'}})

//Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
db.students.update({name: 'Adrian'}, {$pull: {interests: 'Taxes'}})

//Remove all students who are from California.
db.students.remove({home_state: 'CA'})

//Remove a student by name.
db.students.remove({name: 'Fred'})

//Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}}, true)

//Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0}})

//Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.updateMany({home_state: 'WA'}, {$inc: {number_of_belts: 1}})

//Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
db.students.updateMany({}, {$rename: {'number_of_belts': 'belts_earned'}})

//Remove the 'lucky_number' field.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$unset: {'lucky_number': ''}})

//Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {'updated_on': Date()}})
